Heart Disease Prediction App
Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction App is a comprehensive application designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in predicting the likelihood of heart disease using various data inputs. The app integrates multiple functionalities, including predictive analytics, text extraction from images, and a chat bot for interactive assistance.

Key Features
Heart Disease Prediction

The core functionality of the app is its predictive model for heart disease. Users can input various health parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The model processes these inputs to predict the risk of heart disease. This feature is useful for initial screenings and assessments, helping users and healthcare providers make informed decisions.

Text Extraction from Images

The app includes a text extraction feature that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and recognize text from images. This is particularly useful for digitizing handwritten or printed medical documents, reports, and forms. Users can upload images through the app, and the text will be extracted and made available for further use or analysis.

Chat Bot Integration

To enhance user experience and provide real-time support, the app features a chat bot. The chat bot can answer user queries, provide information about heart disease, and assist with using the app’s various features. It utilizes natural language processing to engage in meaningful conversations and offer relevant responses.

Technologies Used
Machine Learning: The heart disease prediction model is built using machine learning algorithms to analyze input data and generate predictions.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): For text extraction from images, the app leverages OCR technology to convert visual text into machine-readable format.
Socket.io: For real-time communication, the app uses Socket.io to facilitate chat bot interactions.
Flutter: The mobile app interface is developed using Flutter, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
Use Cases
Healthcare Providers: Can use the app to quickly assess patients' risk of heart disease based on their health data.
Individuals: Can input their health parameters to get an initial risk assessment and use the chat bot for general health advice.
Document Management: Easily digitize and manage medical documents through text extraction from images.
Benefits
Accuracy: Provides accurate predictions and assessments based on extensive data analysis.
Convenience: Offers an easy-to-use interface for both predictive analytics and text extraction.
Support: Enhances user engagement and support through an interactive chat bot.
